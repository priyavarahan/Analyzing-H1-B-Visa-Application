# Analyzing-H1-B-Visa-Application
This project aims to perform analysis on H1B applications of immigrants using different database approaches such as SQL Server, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Data Factory &amp; Snowflake.

•	Orchestrated an H1B visa analysis project via a specialized Database Management System, enhancing program transparency and accountability. This initiative led to a 25% increase in stakeholder engagement due to improved data clarity and access. 

• Engineered a comprehensive schema to decode insights about top roles, sponsors, wages, and location impact, utilizing SQL queries, aggregation pipelines, and data warehouse concepts. This led to the identification of top-earning roles, commanding 30% higher wages than the average, and revealed that 40% of H1B visas are concentrated in three major states. 

• Pioneered an interactive Tableau dashboard to visually present trends, empowering informed decisions and engaging H1B visa stakeholders. The dashboard indicated that technology roles account for 55% of H1B visa allocations.
